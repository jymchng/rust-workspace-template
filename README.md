## Workspace Overview

This workspace is named `<your-project-name>` and uses the resolver version 2. It includes multiple crates, each serving a specific purpose in the overall project structure. The workspace is configured to use both development and release profiles with specific optimization and debugging settings.

## Crate Descriptions

### proc-macros

This crate contains procedural macros used throughout the project. Procedural macros allow you to write code that generates other code at compile time, making it easier to implement repetitive patterns and boilerplate.

### types

The `types` crate defines common data structures and types used across the workspace. This includes enums, structs, and type aliases that are shared between different crates.

### macros

The `macros` crate provides declarative macros that simplify code by reducing redundancy. These macros are used to generate repetitive code patterns in a concise and maintainable way.

### io

The `io` crate handles input and output operations, including file reading and writing, network communication, and other I/O-related tasks.

### utils

The `utils` crate contains utility functions and helpers that are used throughout the project. These functions provide common functionality that doesn't fit neatly into other crates.

### tests

The `tests` crate includes integration tests for the entire workspace. These tests ensure that all components work together as expected and help maintain code quality.

### bins

The `bins` crate contains binary executables for the project. These executables are the main entry points for running the application.

### errors

The `errors` crate defines custom error types and handling mechanisms used across the workspace. This crate helps standardize error management and improve error reporting.

## Dependencies

The workspace relies on several external dependencies, including:

- `serde` for serialization and deserialization
- `serde_json` for working with JSON data
- `regex` for regular expression matching
- `log` and `env_logger` for logging
- `anyhow` and `thiserror` for error handling
- `clap` for command-line argument parsing
- `toml` for working with TOML files
- `lazy_static` for defining statically initialized values

Each crate within the workspace may also have its own specific dependencies.

## Profiles

The workspace defines two profiles: `dev` and `release`.

### Development Profile

- Optimization level: 1
- Debugging: Enabled
- Overflow checks: Enabled
- Link-time optimization (LTO): Disabled

### Release Profile

- Optimization level: 3
- Debugging: Disabled
- Overflow checks: Enabled
- Link-time optimization (LTO): Enabled
